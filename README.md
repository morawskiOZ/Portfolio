## Info

My landing page to show some of my programming skills. Written in TypeScript with React. Main goal was to create reusable components with individual styling. I used the newest version of React 16.8 with strong emphasis on function components and hooks.

First release is responsive but I will continue to work on this matter.

The backend for this website is created with Node Express. I use it for server rendering and mailing. The repository for [backend](https://github.com/morawskiOZ/Node_Express_Server).
